        <p>
            <strong>Dig Dug</strong> is a 1-2 player arcade game in which you have to use your shovel to dig your way through the earth. <br>
            Stopping you from doing this are two monsters, called <strong>Pooka</strong> and <strong>Fygar</strong>, who will continually chase you around.<br>
            The only weapon that you carry is an air pump, which you can use to inflate the monsters to the point where they <strong>explode</strong>. [...]
