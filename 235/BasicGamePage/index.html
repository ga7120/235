            <blockquote>
                <em><strong>Regicide</strong></em> is a cooperative, fantasy card game for 2 to 4 players, played using a standard deck of cards.
                Players work together to defeat 12 powerful enemies. <br>
                On their turn a player plays a card to the table to attack the enemy and once enough damage is dealt, the enemy is defeated. The players win when the last King is defeated. <br>
                But beware! <br>
                Each turn the enemy strikes back. Players will discard cards to satisfy the damage and if they can't discard enough, everyone loses. <br>
                Rich with tactical decisions and a deep heuristic tree, <em>Regicide</em> is a huge challenge for anyone who is brave enough to take it on. <br>
